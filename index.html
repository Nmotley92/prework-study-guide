           <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
           <li>Separation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
           <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</l1>
           <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</l1>
           <li>Padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</l1>
           <li>Margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</l1>

           <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
           <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. </li>
           <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
